# CEMP
Clustering Ensemble algorithm using optimized Multiobjective Particle (CEMP) in single-cell RNA-seq. CEMP is featured with several mechanisms:

- Multi-subspace projection method;

- Basic partition module in different subspaces;

- Transforming representation between clusters and particles;

- Clustering ensemble optimization.

## Requirement

MATLAB R2016b

## Example

% CEMP(path_data,index_of_similarity,CA,C1,C2,T_index)

% [Results] = CEMP('Data_Treutlin.mat',1,1,1,1,2);
