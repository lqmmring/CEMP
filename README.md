# CEMP
Clustering Ensemble algorithm using optimized Multiobjective Particle (CEMP) in single-cell RNA-seq. CEMP is featured with several mechanisms:

- multi-subspace projection method.

- basic partition module in different subspaces

- transforming representation between clusters and particle

- clustering ensemble optimization

## Requirement

MATLAB R2016b

## Example

% CEMP(path_data,index_of_similarity,CA,C1,C2,T_index)

% [Results] = CEMP('Data_Treutlin.mat',1,1,1,1,2);
